# Audiophile E-commerce Website with React, Redux, Tailwind and Firebase (Firestore and Cloud Storage)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and their challenge for the [Audiophile e-commerce website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx/hub/audiophile-ecommerce-website-abNm2TA0pW).

As with the previous challenge, [Designo Multi-page website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/designo-multipage-website-G48K6rfUT) which I did [here](https://mjbaga.github.io/designo-react/), this was done with React but adding more tools like Redux for store of states, Tailwind for styling and Firebase Firestore for its NoSQL database and Cloud Storage for images. Challenge was done in 7 days of working on the project and it has been a journey. 

Hope this codebase helps fellow developers learning React. Any improvements, feel free to let me know on my email [mjdbaga@gmail.com](mailto:mjdbaga@gmail.com).

Thank you!
